    <p>
      This Instructor Agreement ("Agreement") outlines the terms and conditions between you ("Instructor") and <strong>MyICE</strong> regarding the creation and delivery of educational content on the MyICE platform.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      To become an instructor on MyICE, you must be at least 18 years old and legally able to enter into a binding contract. You must provide accurate and complete information during registration.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">2. Course Ownership</h2>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of the content you create. However, by uploading your course, you grant MyICE a non-exclusive, worldwide license to host, market, and deliver your content to students on the platform.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">3. Instructor Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
      <li>Provide high-quality, original course content</li>
      <li>Maintain accurate course information and updates</li>
      <li>Respond to student questions in a timely manner (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Comply with all applicable laws and MyICE policies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">4. Revenue Share & Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Instructors will receive a percentage of revenue based on course sales, as detailed in the MyICE payout policy. Payments are issued monthly, subject to meeting minimum thresholds and tax compliance.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">5. Prohibited Content</h2>
    <p>
      Content that is plagiarized, illegal, discriminatory, misleading, or violates third-party rights is strictly prohibited. MyICE reserves the right to remove such content without notice.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      You must only upload content that you own or have rights to use. If you use third-party assets (e.g., music, images), you are responsible for ensuring proper licensing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">7. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      Either party may terminate this agreement at any time. Upon termination, your courses may remain available to students who have already enrolled, unless otherwise agreed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">8. Changes to Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      MyICE may update this Agreement from time to time. Continued use of the instructor platform constitutes acceptance of any changes.
