    <p>
      At <strong>MyICE</strong>, protecting your personal information and ensuring the security of our platform is a top priority. This Security Policy outlines the measures we take to safeguard your data.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">1. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>
      We use industry-standard encryption protocols (such as SSL/TLS) to protect data transmitted between your device and our servers. All sensitive information, including passwords and payment details, is encrypted and stored securely.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">2. Access Control</h2>
    <p>
      Access to user data is strictly limited to authorized personnel only. We implement role-based access controls and regularly review permissions to ensure data privacy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">3. Secure Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
      Our servers and infrastructure are hosted in secure data centers with robust physical and network security measures. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted to maintain system integrity.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their login credentials and should use strong, unique passwords. We encourage enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) where available.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">5. Incident Response</h2>
    <p>
      In the event of a data breach or security incident, MyICE has a dedicated response team to quickly address the issue, notify affected users, and take corrective actions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">6. Third-Party Security</h2>
    <p>
      We work only with trusted third-party service providers who comply with stringent security standards to protect your data.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">7. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Security Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with the date of revision.
    </p>
